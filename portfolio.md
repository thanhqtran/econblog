I am interested in Growth models. Simulation in Economics is also fun and interesting.

## Research

**The Aging Tax on Potential Growth in Asia (January 9, 2022)**. [preprint Available at SSRN](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4028464])

| An Application of the OLG model with endogenous retirement and old-age productivity.
## Side Projects

**Simple OLS to assess Chile's Inflation Targeting Policy**.  [Github](https://github.com/thanhqtran/chile-inflationtarget-ols)   [Rpub](https://rpubs.com/thanhqtran/723473)

| Chile adopted the inflation targeting monetary policy since 1991 to reduce economic volatility. We employed an OLS model to confirm that economic growth has been 20% higher thanks to the policy. The data were collected from 1980q1 to 2017q4.

**APG Decomposition for Belgium**. [Rpub](https://rpubs.com/thanhqtran/775009)

| Using R to conduct an Aggregate Productivity Growth decomposition for Belgian economy.

**Genetic Algorith in Finance**. [Github](https://github.com/thanhqtran/finance-agents-GAlearning)

| A simulation code in Python to reproduce Lettau Martin (1997)'s model of a portfolio decision model for boundedly rational agents in a financial market. Agents in this model learn by adopting the genetic algorithm (GA).
