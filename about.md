I am a Ph.D. student at [Tohoku University](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/tohoku-university) (Japan), majoring in Economics.

I belong to the [GPEM](https://www.econ.tohoku.ac.jp/english/page-gpem.html) program (*Global Program in Economics and Management*)

### What is this blog about?

I am a fan of science-fiction.

My favorite series of all time is Asimov's Foundation series.

In there, I learned about a branch of science called 'psychohistory'.
It uses mathematical rigor to simulate a model that can predict the social world and the course of historical events as a whole.

Thus, it's akin to macroeconomics and the similarities between them are what make the study of macroeconomics interesting.

This blog is just a collection of my notes, thoughts, findings during my study. I think writing down benefits both the writer and the readers.  As a researcher, I guess a healthy cycle should be: 

>  think -> write -> consolidate thoughts -> ideas -> repeat.

So this blog is just an implementation of that.
