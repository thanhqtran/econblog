**1. The Aging Tax on Potential Growth in Asia (2022)**. Journal of Asian Economics, Vol. 81, p.101495. [doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101495](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101495)

*Abstract:* Population aging is becoming a prominent issue in Asia, especially for developing countries where demographic changes have asserted a downward pressure on the rate of growth. This paper refers to such potential unwanted effects as an “aging tax” and analytically examines them from a neoclassical perspective, using a Diamond-type overlapping generations model with endogenous retirement, survival rate, and old-age productivity. Based on this setup, negative impacts exist if too many old workers that are sufficiently unproductive choose to defer retirement under the aging pressure, which drains resources from future generations. Numerical simulations show that an aging tax can reduce the potential per capita growth rate (technology-adjusted) by up to 0.12 percentage points annually for some countries in Asia. Our results highlight that countries with sufficiently large labor shares (due to a high ratio of self-employment or a manual labor-centric production) and inadequate educational attainment are potentially the most sensitive and vulnerable to population aging.

## Working Papers

**1. Fertility, Innovation, and Technological Spillovers in An Endogenous Growth Model with Overlapping Generations**

*Abstract:* Since the 1970s, Japan's skill premium has exhibited a U-shape relationship with capital stock or machines per worker, in contrast to some other developed countries. To investigate this puzzle, we build a two-sector Diamond-type Overlapping Generations Model (OLG) with endogenous R\&D-based growth, fertility, education, and skill differentials. The model highlights capital-complimentary technological change, spillover effects from the high-skilled sector to the low-skilled sector, and the quality of parents' education expenses. Our analysis shows that in Japan, since 1975, skill premium first declined due to an oversupply of high-skilled (university graduates) labor ratio, and the technology-capital stock was relatively low. However, as the technology-capital stock keeps increasing, skill premium is predicted to rise, while the ratio of high-skilled individuals can be stagnant in the future. Consistent with observed data, our calibration shows that fertility is expected to fall further so that parents can spend more on children's education and maintain their competitiveness. Counterfactual simulations imply that depending on the strength of the spillovers, different states of equilibrium are realized, with lower (higher) spillover being associated with lower (higher) growth and higher (lower) skill premiums.
