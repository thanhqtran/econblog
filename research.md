I am interested in Macroeconomics, Economic growth and Computational Economics.

## Works

**1. The Aging Tax on Potential Growth in Asia (Jan. 9, 2022)**. [[preprint Available at SSRN]](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.40284644])

\. An OLG model with endogenous retirement and old-age productivity to study the impacts of population aging on potential growth in some Asian economies. We find that aging can harm potential growth if old-age productivity is not high enough, and labor share in production is relatively high.
## Side Projects

**1. Simple OLS to assess Chile's Inflation Targeting Policy**.  [[Github]](https://github.com/thanhqtran/chile-inflationtarget-ols)   [[Rpub]](https://rpubs.com/thanhqtran/723473)


\. Using an OLS model to estimate the effectiveness of the policy on economic growth (result: 20% higher), Chilean data from 1980q1 to 2017q4.

**2. APG Decomposition for Belgium**. [[Rpub]](https://rpubs.com/thanhqtran/775009)


\. Using R to conduct an Aggregate Productivity Growth decomposition for Belgian economy, which shows productivity gains from inputs reallocation.

**3. Genetic Algorith in Finance**. [[Github]](https://github.com/thanhqtran/finance-agents-GAlearning)


\. A simulation code in Python to reproduce Lettau Martin (1997)'s model of a portfolio decision made by boundedly rational agents in the financial market.
