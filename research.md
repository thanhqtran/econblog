<summary>Abstract</summary>
Population aging is becoming a prominent issue in Asia, especially for developing countries where demographic changes have asserted a downward pressure on the rate of growth. This paper refers to such potential unwanted effects as an “aging tax” and analytically examines them from a neoclassical perspective, using a Diamond-type overlapping generations model with endogenous retirement, survival rate, and old worker productivity. Based on this setup, negative impacts exist if too many old workers that are sufficiently unproductive choose to defer retirement under the aging pressure, which drains resources from future generations. Numerical simulations show that an aging tax can reduce the potential per capita growth rate (technology-adjusted) by up to 0.12 percentage points annually for some countries in Asia. Our results highlight that countries with sufficiently large labor shares (due to a high ratio of self-employment or a manual labor-centric production) and inadequate educational attainment are potentially the most sensitive and vulnerable to population aging.

1. Sandwich Caregivers, Elderly Care, and Employment in an OLG Model with Endogenous Fertility. [[PDF]](https://thanhqtran.github.io/wp/QTTran_Elderly.pdf) <details> 
<summary>Abstract</summary>
"Sandwich caregivers" are defined as adults who must care for their dependent parents and children simultaneously. In this paper, we consider an overlapping generations model to study the consequences of such a double burden on their decisions on fertility and career (type of employment). In a fertility-declining environment, subsequent generations face a heavier care burden since they have fewer siblings to share. We show that if the pressure of elderly care on a young worker's time is sufficiently large, more workers will resort to taking nonregular jobs. Furthermore, a sufficiently high upskilling time cost (due to increased studying and training requirements) can prevent the economy from achieving a full regular employment ratio in the long run, regardless of the initial value of the capital stock. We then extend the model to analyze the case when a government elderly care support program is in place. A numerical simulation shows that such a policy can have a positive welfare effect and improve the full-time employment capability of the economy.
