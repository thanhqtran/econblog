### More Information

I am a fan of science-fiction.

My favorite series is the Foundation series (by Asimov).

In there, I learned about a branch of science called 'psychohistory'.
It uses mathematical rigor to simulate and predict the social world, and the course of historical events as a whole.

This blog post is to show my studying and works.
