Constant Elasticity of Substitution neoclassical production. It takes the following general form:

$$
    y = k \left(\alpha x_1^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} + (1-\alpha) x_2^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right)^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}},
$$

where $\sigma$ is the Elasticity of Substitution, $k$ is a shift parameter, or efficiency. The production employs two inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$, with substitutability between them governed by $\sigma$, parameter $\alpha$ shows the weight/importance of each input factor. The production function is homogenous of degree 1.

For notational ease, let:

$$
    \rho = \frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma},
$$

which is called Substitution parameter. Interchangably:

$$
    \sigma = \frac{1}{1-\rho}.
$$

We can rewrite the CES as follows.

$$
    y = k \left( \alpha x_1^\rho + (1-\alpha)x_2^\rho \right)^{1/\rho}.
$$

The elasticity of substitution $\sigma$ varies between 0 and $+\infty$.

When $\sigma \to 0$,
