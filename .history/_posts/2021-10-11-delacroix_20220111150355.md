Notes for the benchmark model of de la Croix's endogenous fertility and education model. This post mostly consists of mathematical derivations and important analytical results.

## Setup

Household's objective function:

$$
U^i_t = \ln(c^i_t) + \gamma \ln(n^i_t \pi(e^i_t))
$$

where $U$ is the life-time utility, $c$ is parent's consumption, $n$ is number of children, $\pi$ is the educational quality of each child. Parents enjoy utility from raising children.

The probability for a child to become skilled (B type):

$$
\pi(e^i) = \mu^i (\theta + e^i)^\eta
$$

where $\mu$ is parent's type $(i)$, specifically $\mu^B > \mu^A$ with B being high-skilled and A being low-skilled. High-skilled workers' children tend to become more educated than the low-skilled counterpart's. $\theta$ is the natural ability of a kid (without parent's money for education) and $e$ is education input a child receives.

Since $1-\pi$ would be the prob. of a child becoming unskilled, the evolution of the population of each cohort is:

$$
 \begin{bmatrix} P^A_{t+1} \\ P^B_{t+1} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} n^A(1-\pi^A(e^A)) & n^B(1-\pi^B(e^B)) \\ n^A \pi^A(e^A) & n^B \pi^B(e^B) \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} P^A_t \\ P^B_t \end{bmatrix}
$$

Parent's budget constraint:

$$
c_t = w(1-\phi n_t) - n_t e_t
$$

where $\phi n$ is the fraction of time devoted to raise children and $ne$ is cost of raising children.

Simple production function:

$$
Y_t = w^A L^A + w^B L^B
$$

where $w$ is the wage-marginal product of labor, $L$ is labor input.

In equilibirum:

$$
P^i_t(1-\phi n_t^i) = L^i_t
$$

where $P$ is type-specific population. The LHS is labor supply and RHS is labor demand.

## Solutions

(temporarily discard the superscript i notation)

Objective function:

$$
\max_{c,e,n} \ U:= \ln(c) + \gamma\ln(n\mu(\theta+e)^\eta) \\
\text{s.t. } \ \ c = w(1-\phi n) - ne
$$

Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \ln(c) + \gamma \ln(n\mu(\theta+e)^\eta) + \lambda (w(1-\phi n) - ne - c)
$$

FOC:

$$
(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c}): c = \frac{1}{\lambda} \\
(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial n}): \frac{\gamma}{n} = \lambda(w\theta+e) \iff n = \frac{\gamma}{\lambda(w\phi + e)} \\ (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial e}): \frac{\gamma \eta (\theta+e)^{\eta-1}}{(\theta + e)^\eta} = \lambda n \\ (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda}): c = w(1-\theta n) - ne
$$

Plugging $n$ into $e$:

$$
\frac{\gamma n}{\theta + e} = \frac{\gamma}{w\phi + e} \iff e = \frac{\eta w \phi - \theta}{1-\eta} $$

Plug this $e$ and $c$ back to $n$ to get:

$$
n = \frac{\gamma c}{w\phi + e} \\ \iff n = \frac{\gamma [w-(w\phi+e)n]}{w\phi +e }\\ \iff n = \frac{\gamma w}{(w\phi +e)(1+\gamma)} \\ \iff n = \frac{\gamma w}{w\phi + \frac{\eta w \phi - \theta}{1-\eta} (1+\gamma)} \\ \iff n = \frac{(1-\eta)\gamma w}{(w\phi - \theta)(1+\gamma)}
$$

Now solve for $c$:

$$
c=w(1-\phi n) - ne \\ \iff c = w - \left(w\phi + \frac{\eta w \phi - \theta}{1-\eta}\right)\frac{(1-\eta)\gamma w}{(w\phi - \theta)(1+\gamma)} \\ \iff c = w - \frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}w = \frac{w}{1+\gamma}
$$

## Comparative statics

We see that:

$$
\frac{\partial e}{\partial w} = \frac{\eta \phi}{1-\eta} > 0
$$

Parental education spending increases with income.

On the other hand:

$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial w} = - \theta \frac{(1-\eta)(1+\gamma)\gamma}{\left[(w\phi-\theta)(1+\gamma)\right]^2} < 0
$$

Fertility decreases with income.

$e > 0$ if

$$
w > \frac{\theta}{\eta \phi}
$$

otherwise: if

$$( e \leq 0 ) \begin{cases} &e=0 \\ &n = \frac{\gamma w}{w\phi (1+\gamma)} = \frac{\gamma}{\phi(1+\gamma)} \end{cases}$$

From here, we can calculate the range of $n$:

For the lower bound:

$$
\lim_{w\to \infty} n = \lim_{w\to \infty} \frac{(1-\eta)\gamma w}{(w\phi - \theta)(1+\gamma)}\\ = \lim_{w\to \infty} \frac{(1-\eta)\gamma}{(\phi - \frac{\theta}{w})(1+\gamma)} = \frac{(1-\eta)\gamma}{\phi(1+\gamma)}
$$

For the upper bound:

$$
\frac{\lim_{w\to0} n}{\lim_{w\to\infty}n} = \frac{\frac{\gamma}{\phi(1+\gamma)}}{\frac{(1-\eta)\gamma}{\theta(1+\gamma)}} = \frac{1}{1-\eta}
$$
