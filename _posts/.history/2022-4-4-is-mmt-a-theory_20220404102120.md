1.	The origin of MMT
MMT was originally a developed based on Chartalism (by German economist Knapp in 1905), an economic thinking that money is more of a way for the state to control & direct economic activity rather than just a mere means of exchange. MMT also based on Keynesian emphasis on fiscal policy, demand driven economics. In 1986, Hyman Minsky in a book called Stabilizing an Unstable Economy revived the central role of the state to fix market failure that later became very influential to MMT thinkers. However, it is after the unusual economic circumstance in the world like the global financial crisis, zero interest rate, low inflation, rounds of quantitative easing and the Eurozone Debt Crisis that truly triggered questions about the consequence of fiat money, limits of monetary policies and revival of the role of the states. These questions inspired economists like Warren Mosler, L. Randall Wray, Stephanie Kelton (University of Missouri-Kansas City), Bill Mitchell (University of Newcastle, NSW), Pavlina R. Tcherneva (Bard College) to formally systemize the idea into a new theory. With heavy prominence on fiscal policy and money creation discretion, MMT claims itself to be a branch of Post-Keynesian Economics. 
2.	The key points in MMT theory
The best way to understand MMT is to compare its core theory with other dominant economic ideologies (e.g. monetarist) on some main premises. 
a.	Sovereign Currency & the role of money
The first and one of the most important set-up for MMT is laid in notion of sovereign currency. According to MMT, a sovereign currency is the currency that is monopolistically issued by a central government of a country, such government imposes tax payment and issues bonds based on its own currency and most importantly, the currency does not peg on other currencies, which means that the monetary system must be free-floating exchange rate. Given these conditions, there are only limited countries in the world that have sovereign currency, such as the United States (with its USD), Japan (with its JPY), Australia (with AUD), the United Kingdom (with GBP). One special case is the Euro (EUR). It is one of the free-floated currencies, Eurozone governments collect taxes and issue bonds based on EUR but it is not considered a sovereign currency because countries that adopt EUR have abolished its monopoly power of currency issuing. With this foundation, MMT and its policy implications pledge to hold true only if sovereign currency economy prevails and may lose some of its logical senses when applied to other economies.
The above point brings us to a new identity of money. In classical thought, under Gold Standard or its successor, Gold Exchange Standard, money was based and pegged on gold, or based on a reserve currency (USD) that based and pegged on gold. Because gold is finite, money was believed to be finite, and therefore government fiscal responsibility must be protected. However, things have changed since the abolishment of gold standard, giving way for fiat-currencies that based on nothing. Therefore, for countries like the US, UK, Japan, Australia, the government actually can service their debts denominated their own currencies just by “printing” money. Sovereign money now can be considered infinite. 
By this new definition, one will wonder whether money will tend to lose its value because it can be printed without any consequences. The answer is no. On the contrary, the whole premise of MMT will collapse if money loses its value, in other words, loses in demand. The demand for the sovereign currency needs to be maintained. Sovereign government (like the US) can keep this demand to maintain in high level by the means of tax impose in its sovereign currency (e.g. USD). Furthermore, economic performance and economic influence of such sovereign currency is also important to keep the world’s demand for its currency stable. As the result, fitting in this criterion, we can see that only a handful of economies satisfied to adopt MMT, such as the US, Japan, UK, Australia, etc.
b.	Inflation & Government Deficit
Now with the foundation established in section a., MMT can give us some provoking insights to counter mainstream economics’ concerns on inflation and government debt.
Following the aftermath of the GFC in 2008, central banks (notably Fed, BOE, BOJ, ECB) have started to boost their respective economy by using extremely expansionary monetary policies, raising bank reserves (disposable credit) and easing financial conditions by Quantitative Easing. The monetary base expanded and interest rates reached historically low levels in these nations. This is the orthodox response of central banks to battle deflation. Critics were concerned at that time as overwhelming monetary supply can lead to hyper inflation in Japan or the US like it happened in Zimbabwe in 2008 or Venezuela in recent years. However, there was nothing of the sort happened in reality. Surprisingly, especially in the case of Japan, these actions were not considered “big” enough to lead to desired inflation (2%), let alone hyperinflation. Why? According MMT, the are 2 big reasons that can be derived. First of all, the USD, JPY or GBP and other sovereign currency are of different status as Zimbabwe’s and Venezuela’s. They are sovereign currency, fully controlled by the government, while Zimbabwe’s and Venezuela’s in fact peg their currencies to USD, which is totally out of government’s control. Furthermore, the demand for these currencies are high enough to absorb new supply of money, in other words, the demand for stable and highly-regarded currencies can be regarded inelastic to the supply side. Inflation should be understood as the phenomenon when demand surpasses the capacity of the economy to supply adequate goods and services. For countries that have a strong supply power like the US, UK or Japan, the problem lies at the demand side, not the supply side. To reach a certain desired rate of inflation, actively boosting demand is the answer. The fact that QE, or monetary policy failed to raise inflation rate despite huge amount of money supply implies that there are some severe lags, lacks of demand that the market finds it hard to utilize by itself. Therefore, government sector, by the use of fiscal policy, once again appears to be the main key to drive growth. By this logic, MMT can be considered the successor of Keynesian economics, as of now known as Post Keynesian.
This brings us to the next questions that mainstream economists will ask: What about government deficits? We all know what happened to Greece, Spain and Italy from 2015 as the result of a huge accumulation of public debt for fiscal funding? The answer to that question by MMT is simple. Government deficits is not necessarily a bad thing. Remember, sovereign government can finance its debts because sovereign government has discretion in money creation. But Greece and other countries in the Eurozone had abandoned their currencies for the unified Euro, gave up their monetary autonomy, therefore they lost the crucial tool to service debts. Moreover, MMT proves that government deficits go in hand with or equal to private sector savings, because government will spend the money into the economy and this becomes private income. More income, more wealth, more spending. Deficit, thus is not a bad thing. Furthermore, 2% government-debt-to-GDP ratio is not better than 10% government-debt-to-GDP ratio. Additional fiscal stimulus needed for each country is different, so long as fiscal policy can be used to utilize available resources that private sector cannot, sovereign government do not need to worry about debts growing.
This fact in turn may diminish the role of taxation in MMT because the government does not need to rely on tax to fund for its spending. However, MMT insisted that tax is needed to maintain sovereign currency demand. Tax also plays a vital role in the redistribution of wealth, in protecting the environment by carbon tax. Tax is also an alternative tool to control inflation in the situation where business is inflexible to interest rates, as in the case of Japan. 
c.	Employment
Employment is another facet that MMT touches. It argues that an economy actually can reach “zero unemployment”, unlike the settling idea advocated by Milton Friedman that there is always a natural rate of unemployment exists, that unemployment cannot reach zero. In general, mainstream economists consent that the natural rate of unemployment includes frictional unemployment (people temporary moving jobs) and structural unemployment (people lost jobs due to technological advances). We will focus on the structural unemployment. One way to tackle this is to rely on government sector for job creation program. According to Warren Mosler, the idea is to create many skills improving or training jobs where structural unemployed person can join. They will be temporarily employed by government programs to be trained, learn new working skills, produce income, prepare for one day to be employed back in the private sector. 
As we have already established that fiscal policy is necessary to utilize the unused resources available in the economy and the government have sufficient funds in their sovereign currency, MMT holds a strong implication for policymakers. 
3.	MMT’s policy implications for Japan
Japan is a sovereign state that holding monopoly power on its own currency, the Japanese Yen (JPY), therefore there is no doubt that it is an MMT material. Japan has been relying on monetary policy to battle against deflation ever since 1999 with Zero Interest Rate policy. However, the expansion of monetary base and decreasing interest rates have failed to help Japan reach desired 2% inflation rate. Accumulation of government debt over 200% of GDP has created fear among the public, forcing the government to raise consumption tax in order to fund for fiscal stimulus, thus weakened domestic demand.
In this manner, many research have proved that monetary policy in Japan has actually run out of stimulating instrument. Indeed, it is expected that the key player in boosting Japanese economy will be in P.M Shinzo Abe’s fiscal stimulus. On December 05, 2019, the Japanese government approved an extra 121 billion USD of fiscal stimulus for this fiscal year (which shall last until March 2020). This package will be spent on infrastructure for the Olympic 2020, repairing some damaged buildings and investment on highway expansions. P.M Abe asserts that more fiscal stimulus will be on the way, focusing on subsidizing small and middle-size business, especially in digital-driven industry, or sensitive industries like forestry & fisheries. 
It is unquestionable how MMT has become popular in Japanese debates. By applying this doctrine, government possess the mean to justify its spending and further accumulation of debts. This degree of freedom in money creation can be beneficial if fiscal stimulus utilized resources in the economy. However, it also poses the peril of corruption and misallocation of funds for political gains, as money now at the government’s total disposal.
