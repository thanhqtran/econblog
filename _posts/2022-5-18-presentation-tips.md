As a major presentation is coming, here are some BIG tips in giving presentations that I've learned. (the famous BIG 5)

In the first 5 minutes, tell the audience these:

1. **What are you doing?** In 25 words, plain English, tell them the question you are trying to find an answer for.
2. **Why is it important?** Why should someone care about your research? To understand economic concept, to know what should be intervened
3. **How is the existing literature deficient?** Focus on what's NOT there, tell them the gap you are trying to fill.
4. **What are you doing that’s better?** One or two short sentence. Bold. Plain English. Make everyone knows exactly what your niche is.
5. **What did you find?** the TAKEAWAY. Tell them the results and an intuitive explanation. Make them remember your research and its results.

While presenting the BIG 5:
- Don't use jargon
- Avoid extraneous details
- Repeat if needed. Better to be redundant than misunderstood.

After Big 5, "serve" the presentation:
- **The Intuitive Appetizer**: begins with an interlude called *“How I got the idea for this paper*. There were no equations, charts, tables, or props of any sort. Just an informal chat filled with 
easy-to-understand intuition. HOW You got the idea is equally important.
- **The Main Dish**: Balance between technicality and intuition.
