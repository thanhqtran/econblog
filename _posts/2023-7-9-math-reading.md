## Math

- **Basic**
  - Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis (Sydsaeter, Hammond, Carvajal) -- covering algebra and very elementary subjects -- easy to read and a good start for those who are not so good at math.
  - Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics (Alpha Chiang) -- covering a wide range of topics in static optimization and matrix algebra (without dynamic optimization) with lots of useful formulae and exposition.
  - Elements of Dynamic Optimization (Alpha Chiang) -- covering well-explained Calculus of Variations and Optimal control theory (Dynamic Optimization).
  - The Structure of Economics: A Mathematical Analysis (Eugene Silverberg). -- student-friendly with a lot of necessary derivations that often omitted in textbooks.
- **Advanced**
  - Mathematics for Economists (Simon, Blume) -- the classic everyone should read and master.
  - Mathematical Methods and Models for Economists (Angel de la Fuente) -- a good addition to the previous one with more economic applications (models)
  - Further Mathematics for Economic Analysis (Sydsaeter, Hammond) -- More advanced topics in Differential Equations, Calculus of Variations, Optimal Control theory.
  - Mathematical Optimization and Economic Theory (Intrilligator) -- Feels like Simon & Blume's sister.
  - Introduction to Mathematical Statistics (Hogg, McKean, Craig) -- saved me a lot in Statistics and Probability class (pre econometrics)
- **Proofs**
  - How to Prove It (Velleman)
  - How to read and do proofs: an introduction to mathematical thought processes (Solow)
  - Elementary Real Analysis (Thompson and Bruckner) -- gentle introduction to Real Analysis.
  - Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Rudin)
  - Elementary Classical Analysis (J. Marsden) -- Rudin's companion
  - Introduction to Real Analysis (Bartle)

## Micro

- Microeconomic Analysis (Hal Varian) -- extremely intuitive
- Microeconomic Theory (Mas-Colell / Whinston / Green)
- **Game Theory**
  - A Course on Game Theory (Osborne & Rubinstein)
  - *Basics*: Games, Strategies, and Decision Making (Harrington) & Stratery (Watson)
  - *Advanced*: Game Theory: an introduction (Tadelis), Game Theory for Applied Economists (Gibbons), Strategy and Game Theory: Practice Exercises with Answers (Munoz-Garcia & Toro-Gonzalez)

## Macro

- **Transitional** (fast read and good build-up)
  - Advanced Macroeconomics: An Introduction for Undergraduates -- covering Hamiltonian, and basic Ramsey
  - Introduction to Economic Growth (C.I.Jones) -- Solow, Romer's and Jones' endogenous growth theory. The Math appendix is very helpful.
  - Unified Growth Theory (Galor) -- good introduction to OLG and microfounded macro dynamics

- **Classics**
  - Economic Growth (Barro, Sala-i-Martin) -- people praised the appendix for a good reason. A lot of empirical evidence.
  - Advanced Macroeconomics (Romer) -- not really "that" technical but the explanation is superb. Also accompanied by a solutions manual.
  - Introduction to Modern Economic Growth (Acemoglu) -- quite technical with lots of proofs for a good reason. The book contains everything you need. There is one Solutions Manual by Peters and Simsek.
  - Lectures on Macroeonomics (Blanchard, Fischer) -- I like the continous and discrete treatment of the OLG.
  - Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics (Heijdra) -- literature survey with good explanations and comprehensive package. There is one companion book "Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics: Exercise & Solutions Manual"
  - Advanced Macroeconomics: An Easy Guide (Campante, Sturzenegger, Velasco) -- very much like Heijdra's
  - Intertemporal Macroeconomics (Azariadis) -- lots of graphs and dynamical systems that give you the idea of how your model should look like.
  - [Groth's Lecture Notes in Macroeconomics](https://web.econ.ku.dk/okocg/VM/VM-general/Material/Chapters-VM.htm)
