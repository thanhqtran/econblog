There was an interesting post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/17pwuu8/how_can_i_be_expected_to_vote_without_a_phd_in/) the other day about what most economists agree upon. The post points out the importance of consensus among economists. Here are some of the links cited there.
