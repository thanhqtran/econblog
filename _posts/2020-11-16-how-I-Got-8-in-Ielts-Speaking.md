title: How I got 8 in IELTS Speaking!
---
{kramdown: style="text-align: justify"}
It's been 2 weeks since I took the test again after 2 years. I was a little bit nervous because I didn't do so well in the previous test. I only got 6.0 in Speaking, which (obviously) doesn't reflect well enough my speaking skills. I think many people have the same problem that I had, your pronunciation is good, the stress, the intonation, the fluency are all superb, people don't even recognize your accent, and of course you already have a general idea of the topic you are talking, yet why we tend to get only average or even subpar speaking score? The answer is, my friend, lies in the way you persuade the judge, not how good your English is, but how skillful and erudite you are when handling the language. In other words, you need to show off, everything you have!

I couldn't have realized this poweerful message without the help from a lovely Australian lady that I know from our university's Economics department, whom has great experience on teaching English. She understands very well how the test is graded.

First of all, you need to understand how the judge see your speaking performance. In the end, IELTS is a standardized test, which means there are various criteria that evaluators must base upon to grade you. The specifics of the criteria, of course, are not available to public or via the official handbook, but we can take a good guess. If you want to get a high score on speaking, you'd better nail down every single bullet point below:
* lots of big/rare words
* lots of grammatical variations
* lots of details
* use figure of speech
* ALWAYS answer questions with at least 2 sentences
* ALWAYS answer the questions in the exact order they were laid out.

Some of the bullet points above seem trivial, like the last 2, but they are not easy to strike without preparations. With the mindset of showing off what I got in English, let me tell you how I prepare for each one of them.

**Big words**

This post is meant for people aiming at scoring at least 7 or above, so I assume you are very experienced with English. Big words, rarely used words are not really popular and common in daily use, so it is quite challenging to remember and be able to bring them out right out of the blue. But there are ways.

First, you need to know the source. Most of the words are very abstract, like: epistomological, inductive(philosophical), partisan, etymology,
